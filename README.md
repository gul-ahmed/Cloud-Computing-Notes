# What is the cloud ?

- "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are in data centres all over the world.
- The term Cloud refers to a Network or Internet. In other words, we can say that Cloud is something, which is present at remote location. Cloud can provide services over network, i.e., on public networks or on private networks.
- Cloud refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
- This network of servers is collectively known as "the cloud." Cloud computing enables users to access and use computing resources (such as storage, processing power, and applications) on-demand, over the internet, without the need for local infrastructure or management.
- The cloud provides scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, allowing businesses and individuals to leverage computing resources without the burden of owning and maintaining physical hardware.

# What is the cloud Computing ?

- Cloud computing is a technology paradigm (commonly accepted way or model) that involves delivering computing services—including storage, processing power, and applications—over the internet.
- Instead of relying on local servers or personal devices, users access and utilize these resources from a network of remote servers, often referred to as "the cloud."
- Cloud computing provides on-demand access to scalable and flexible computing resources, allowing individuals and organizations to efficiently and cost-effectively deploy and manage applications, store and retrieve data, and perform various computing tasks without the need for significant local infrastructure or upfront investment.


# Advantages of cloud computing

**Cost Efficiency:**

Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront investments in physical infrastructure. Users can pay for services on a pay-as-you-go basis, reducing capital expenses.


**Scalability:**

Cloud services offer the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand. This flexibility allows businesses to adapt quickly to changing needs without over-provisioning.


**Accessibility:**

Cloud services can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, providing users with the flexibility to work remotely and access resources on various devices.

**Reliability and Availability:**

Leading cloud providers offer high levels of reliability and redundancy, ensuring that services are available and data is backed up regularly. This minimizes downtime and data loss.

**Security:**

Cloud providers invest heavily in security measures, often exceeding what individual organizations can implement. This includes data encryption, authentication, and advanced threat detection.

**Automatic Updates:**

Cloud service providers handle system maintenance, updates, and upgrades, ensuring that users always have access to the latest features and security patches without manual intervention.

**Disaster Recovery:**

Cloud services often include robust backup and disaster recovery capabilities. Data is regularly backed up, and cloud providers offer options for quickly restoring data in the event of a disaster.


# Basic Concepts
There are certain services and models working behind the scene making the cloud computing feasible and accessible to end users. Following are the working models for cloud computing:
1. Deployment Models
2. Service Models

## DEPLOYMENT MODELS
Deployment models define the type of access to the cloud, i.e., how the cloud is located? Cloud can have any of the four types of access: Public, Private, Hybrid and Community.

1. PUBLIC CLOUD
2. PRIVATE CLOUD
3. HYBRID CLOUD
4. COMMUNITY CLOUD

| Cloud Type       | Description                                                                                                    | Example                                                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PUBLIC CLOUD** | Resources and services are provided over the internet by third-party providers and are available for use by the general public. Multiple customers share the same infrastructure, benefiting from cost efficiencies. | Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). |
| **PRIVATE CLOUD**| Computing resources are exclusively used by a single organization. The infrastructure may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization itself or by a third party, and it can be located on-premises or off-site. | A company using its own data center infrastructure for exclusive use.  |
| **HYBRID CLOUD** | Combines elements of both public and private clouds. It allows data and applications to be shared between them, providing greater flexibility and more deployment options. This enables organizations to use the public cloud for scalable tasks while keeping sensitive data on-premises. | A company using a private cloud for sensitive data and a public cloud for scalable computing power. |
| **COMMUNITY CLOUD** | Infrastructure is shared among several organizations that have common concerns, such as regulatory compliance or industry-specific requirements. It is managed either by the organizations or a third party. | Multiple healthcare organizations sharing a cloud infrastructure to store and manage health data. |




## SERVICE MODELS

Cloud computing offers services through various models, each defining the level of control, responsibility, and functionality that users have.

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

| Service Model               | Description                                                                                                                      | Example                                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** | Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components on a pay-as-you-go basis. It gives more control over the infrastructure compared to other models. | Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines. |
| **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** | Offers a platform that includes not only the infrastructure but also the tools and services needed to develop, test, and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying hardware or software. It simplifies the development process. | Google App Engine, Heroku.                  |
| **Software as a Service (SaaS)** | Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access the software through a web browser without the need for installation and maintenance. It's a ready-to-use solution. | Google Workspace, Salesforce, Microsoft 365. |

Each service model provides a different level of abstraction and management, catering to diverse needs and preferences. 

IaaS offers more control and customization. 

PaaS streamlines application development.

SaaS simplifies software access and maintenance for end-users. 

Often, these models are used in combination to create a comprehensive and flexible cloud computing environment.


## What Is a Shared Responsibility Model? 
A shared responsibility model is a framework used in the cloud computing world to define the respective security responsibilities of the customer and the cloud provider. In this model, the cloud service provider is obligated to secure the underlying infrastructure of the cloud, including physical security, network security, and hypervisor security. The customer, on the other hand, retains the responsibility for securing the data and applications they store and use in the cloud environment, including access control, data encryption, and security configuration.

- CUSTOMER = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY IN THE CLOUD
- AWS = RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SECURITY OF THE CLOUD
